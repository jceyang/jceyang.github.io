            As a part of <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.calaaf.com">imagiCal</a>,
            UC Berkeley's award-winning competitive strategy and marketing team, I
            worked with <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.airbnb.com">Airbnb</a> to conduct research and
            formulate product solutions on pain points in the payment process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along the way, I learned about payment pain points, UIUX principles,
            and&#8212;to my surprise&#8212;the immense complexity of the psychology behind payment
            models.

          The Ask + Methodology
        </div>
        <p>
          We were asked to understand the severity of pain points in the payment
          process and then determine the strategic focus of product solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to do this, we split our process into 3 steps:
          <b>

        <div id="painPointIdentification">
        <div class="title">
          Pain Point Identification
        </div>
        <p>
          In order to identify pain points, we conducted intensive research using
          over 466 survey respondents from 33 states, 25 individual interviews,
          and 3 focus groups&#8212;thereby creating a diverse data set to make our
          initial hypotheses. We then broadened our understand with an analysis of
          competitors such as Expedia, Homeaway, and Trip Advisor.
        </p>
          <div class="h1">
            Through our research, we learned that:
          </div>
          <div class="highlightP">
            1. <b>Security concerns</b> were a key issue with payments, due to a lack of
            transparency with payment securities.
          </div>
          <div class="highlightP">
            2. Those who booked on behalf of groups had <b>discomfort paying the full amount
            upfront</b>, due to <b>lags in reimbursement</b> and reluctance in fronting the cost.
          </div>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, our 2 main pain points were <b>payment security concerns</b> and
          <b>discomfort with full payment upfront</b>.
        </p>

          Pain Point Diagnosis + Analysis
        </div>
        <p>
          Having identified our pain points, we performed deep dives into each respective
          problem to understand where concerns rooted from and user preferences.
        </p>

          Pain Point 1: Payment Security Concerns &#8212; Diagnosis
        </div>
        <p>
          Through comparative research, we determined that the key difference between Airbnb and
          its competitors was payment protection branding in the payment process. Competitors used
          this to market their security policies, while <b>Airbnb lacked any branding at all when it came
          to payment security</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          From our research, we also learned that even a simple statement of security or logo indicating security
          massively improved confidence in the process.
        </p>

          Pain Point 2: Discomfort with Full Payment Upfront &#8212; Diagnosis
        </div>
        <p>
          Through further user research, we determined that the majority of users who booked on behalf of a group used a
          form of split payment to divide the cost. For instance, users commonly used Venmo as
          a primary form of payment splitting/reimbursement.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
          Using the information gathered from the identification and diagnosis stages,
          we developed product solutions and created solution mock-ups.
        </p>
        <div class='h1'>
          Pain Point 1: Payment Security Concerns &#8212; Product Solution
        </div>
        <p>
          In order to combat payment security concerns, we proposed revisions to the current
          payment process UI, by including a statement and logo indicating payment security.
          This clearly communicate to the customer the transaction process and
          how their payment is protected to alleviate any security concerns

        <p>
          Knowing that most users usually used a form of payment splitting such as Venmo to
          cover reimbursements, we developed two different production solutions to alleviate this.
        </p>
        <div class="highlightP">
          1. <b>Venmo integration</b> with checkout, removing the friction in moving
          to a different platform to complete reimbursements.
        </div>
        <div class="highlightP">
          2. <b>Native split payment model</b>, which gives a 24-hour window for friends to pay
          to pay for the house.
